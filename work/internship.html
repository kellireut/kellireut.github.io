            <p class="intro-paragraph">During the spring semester of my senior year, I completed my internship credit for my advertising degree. Below are short explainations and examples of my work from this semester. </p>

            <article class="alumni-relations">
                <h1 class="heading_primary">Alumni Relations Strategic Plan</h1>
                <p>My main project for this semester was to create a strategic plan to increase engagement with Digital Corps Alumni. The team and I conducted research about how other institutions stay connected with their alumni, then presented a strategic plan that would fit the culture and needs of the Corps. </p>
                <p>Linked here is the presentation we delivered to the staff members. We also created a detailed GOST outline for further reference.</p>

            <article class="philosophy-site">
                <h1 class="heading_primary">Philosophy Outreach Project Website</h1>
                <p>I also worked with an immersive learning class from the Philosophy department at Ball State this semester. The class works to introduce high school students in the study of philosophy through online resources, school visits and an annual conference. They had a website(link) with most of the information, but came to the Corps to get a more customized and comprehensive online presence that complies with the Ball State brand guidelines. </p>
                <p>The main design feature of the site is the custom illustrations on every page. While pitching her vision to us, the client showed several websites that all had custom-drawn elements on them. The team picked up on this and decided it was fitting for the target audience of high school students to break out of the typical minimalistic design. </p>
                <p>The designs are in an early draft right now, but can be viewed with the link below. </p>
