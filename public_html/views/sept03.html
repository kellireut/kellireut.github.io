        <h1>What design is, according to me</h1>
        <h2>
            Functionality is vital, but aesthetic is important to. I talk about the effect of design and my experience with buying nuts online. I also give some of my favorite inspiration sources.
        </h2>

                Design, at first, is pretty straight forward. It’s taking something and making it look nice as well as function in a way that is worth something to someone. But, as with all things, I can’t look at design in only one light. The ultimate goal of design is to create a product with great functionality and usability, while also using sensory details in a way that makes the product beneficial to anybody who encounters it. Product has a very wide definition here. Anything produced by humans has a design, from printed graphics to a side table, to a road. Design is all around us. Good design makes our lives better, but is often unnoticeable. Bad design, on the other hand, will cause annoyances and stand out very clearly to the consumer.

                There’s so much more to design than the visuals, but that doesn’t mean visual design does not deserve the attention it receives. A product’s worth is usually found in its functionality and usability. My focus is web design, so I’ll use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> as an example. Objectify, it does not have good visual design. Yet, they have millions of users around the world because the site offers a valuable experience that cannot be found elsewhere. I would argue Reddit is the expectation to the rule, however. Based on the time period when Reddit developed its niche audience and the fact it has no direct competitors, users will put up with the poor aesthetic because it functions exactly as it is supposed to. In the present day, if a company is trying to establish a name for itself, there’s little chance it could get away with having a design style like Reddit. If that company has direct competitors, the chances go down even more. Humans are attracted to things that bring them pleasure, and beautifully designed websites will attract more customers.

                As an example of why visuals do matter, I’ll talk about my recent adventure of buying five pounds of nuts in bulk online. (Weird, I know, but I really like trail mix.) I found two sites: <a href="https://nuts.com/" target="_blank">nuts.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bulkfoods.com/" target="_blank">bulkfoods.com</a>. Bulkfoods was higher in the Google results list, but I didn’t give it much credit at first. The logo is atrocious and the rest of the site doesn’t look much better. When I clicked on nuts.com, I was very pleased and started adding stuff to my cart right away. If nuts wouldn’t be so expensive ($17 for a pound of macadamias?! No thanks.), I would put in my Paypal and been done right then and there, not even concerned about finding better prices. But, I thought about it a little bit and decided to at least compare prices. I didn’t expect to change my mind, but better to be safe than sorry. Turns out, ordering through Bulkfoods would save me more than $10. I was still skeptical, though. Why? Because I trusted Nuts. They looked like they knew what they were doing. Everything was laid out so nicely, they had cool fonts, they even had little characters! Company owners don’t put that much effort into something they don’t care about. I immediately trusted Nuts more than Bulkfoods based on the aesthetic, but because I’m a broke college student I convinced myself to give badly designed company a chance.

                 As mentioned earlier, my career focus is web design. I work at Digital Corps on campus, designing and building websites from scratch on a daily basis. I can’t help but judge a company if they have poor design, no matter the medium or purpose of the design. Good companies understand the importance of design and will invest to make sure they can give that to their customers. Design choices heavily influence my decisions when choosing brands to support and I like to surround myself with good design in things such as my phone background or decorations in my apartment. Design is all around us, so it might as well be good design.

                 For my own design work, I find inspiration from a lot of places on the web. My favorite place is Twitter, where I follow designers who I look up to. Some of them post their own work pretty often, but they also share work from their peers as well. A favorite is Sarah Drasner (<a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo" target="_blank">@sarah_edo</a>), a designer and front-end developer who has a <a href="https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/" target="_blank">killer website</a>.

                 I also use web-specific sites like <a href="https://codepen.io/pens/" target="_blank">codepen.io</a> pretty often to find ideas for micro-aspects of my designs. Like <a href="https://codepen.io/kjbrum/pen/wBBLXx?q=button+hover+effect&limit=all&type=type-pens" target="_blank">this pen</a> with several examples of hover states on buttons.

                 When looking for a unique way to tell a story, I found <a href="http://onesharedhouse.com/">One Shared House</a> very interesting. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://work.antonandirene.com/onesharedhouse/" target="_blank">behind the scenes</a> as well. That is some quality design thinking right there.

                 For typography, I like to look at <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" target="_blank">Typewolf</a>. One of my recent favorites is <a href="https://www.getvinebox.com/" target="_blank">Vinebox</a>.

                 I struggle with finding inspiration online for print design, but I often find myself turning to <a href="https://www.designspiration.net" target="_blank">Designspiration</a> for help.

                 This selection is so small, but these are among my favorites and have consistently stayed on my list. There’s so many places to get inspiration, and most of them cannot be linked or displayed on the web. The key is to constantly be experiencing things and thinking about them with a designer’s perspective. Out of that, ideas are formed and you create something beautiful and functional and make someone’s day a little bit easier.
