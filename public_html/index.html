			<h4>Here's the facts: </h4>
			<div>
				<p>I’m a student at Ball State University in Muncie, IN.</p>
				<p>I study advertising and digital media.</p> 
				<p>I work with the Digital Corps as a web designer, conceptualizing and coding websites from start to finish.</p>

		<div class="section other">
			<h4>Here's the rest:</h4>
			<div>
				<p>I’m in love with life and few things make me happier than bringing joy to other people. My time in college has challenged and changed me in more ways than I could have dreamed of. I have successfully surrounded myself with people who are smarter than me, which means I always have the oppurtunity to learn something new.</p>
				<p>I have a unique background of advertising classes and web design and development experience. I work for a super cool place called the Digital Corps (like the Marine Corps, but less intense) where I collaborate with some of the best students on campus to create solutions for real-world clients. My passion lies in CSS because that is where I see the worlds of design and development colliding. I also have print design and publicity experience from working with Cardinal Catholic, the student organization for Catholic students on campus. I plan to combine my varied experiences with my love of helping people in a job that helps me make the world a better place.</p>
				<p>I am in the process of coding the rest of this site, but please feel free to check out my work on Behance with the big yellow link at the right.</p>
